# Scaffold

A card game for two, with competitive or cooperative play modes.

## What it is

Scaffold is a card game which can be played with a single deck of card in competitive mode. In cooperative mode you'll need to be able to track turns with either 16 counters or pen and paper.

It was designed by Simon Kenny at the Global Game Jam 2020 in Galway, Ireland. Darren Kearney and Michael Murphy collaborated on game design, and Brian O'Brien and Pepe were play testers, also contributing to the project.
